# TechnoHacks EduTech - My Data Science Project
 Welcome to the TechnoHacks EduTech Data Science Internship repository. This repository contains solutions and implementations for three key tasks in data science: House Price Prediction, Fraud Transaction Detection, and Email Spam Filtering.  Tasks Overview: House Price Prediction: Predicting house prices is crucial for real estate market analysis and investment decisions. This task involves utilizing various machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on features such as location, size, amenities, and historical pricing data.  Fraud Transaction Detection: Detecting fraudulent transactions is essential for financial security and fraud prevention. In this task, we explore techniques such as anomaly detection and supervised learning to identify abnormal transactions from legitimate ones using transactional data features.  Email Spam Filtering (Spam Mail Prediction): Email spam remains a significant issue in communication. This task focuses on classifying emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We employ machine learning models to categorize emails based on their content and structural features.
